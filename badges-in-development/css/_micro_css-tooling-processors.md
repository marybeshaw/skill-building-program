Est. to complete: {2}h

## Goal

knowledge.
- You should have some experience using some techniques such as CSS 
Pre-processors, Post-processors, Linters and Formatters, Reducing Redundancy 
and Unused Styles, Minification, and Generating Critical Path CSS, to make you 
more productive and expressive by automating some of the more tedious parts of 
building highly optimized CSS for the browser.
