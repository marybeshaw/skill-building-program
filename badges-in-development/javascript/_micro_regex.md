## Intro

>Some people, when confronted with a problem, think “I know, I'll use regular expressions.” Now they have two problems. – James Zawinski

>All developers should learn to use basic regular expressions, because they'll produce better, more flexible, more maintainable code with them. – Jeff Atwood

## Suggested Assignment
Choose One:

1) Watch this amazing video from Lea Verou – [Demystifying Regular Expressions (48m)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkluES9Rvak)

2) Work through the lessons on [RegexOne](http://regexone.com/)

Then solve the following problems, demonstrating and showing your solutions:

1) Get the `src` value for all `script` tags - http://regexr.com/3cr6i
  - make sure you use a capture group around the value

2) Get the `src` value for all `script` tags that do not start with `http` - http://regexr.com/3cr6i

3) Find all translation substitutions – http://regexr.com/3cr6f
  - starts with a `{`
  - contains a number or key name (whitespace allowed)
  - ends with a `}`
  - do not capture the angular bindings (double `{{}}`)

Bonus (extremely difficult)

1) Find all translation substitutions where translations can be next to each other – http://regexr.com/3cr74
