-----

Est. to complete: 3hrs

## Goals

- You have demonstrated foundational knowledge in launching production elements on GitHub and webcomponents.org.
- You should have be familiar with all steps required to publish and share a new web component.

-----

## Intro

> “Open source is neither something to be feared nor is it a panacea... it’s just software.” - The IT guys at Aviall

Shared code within a company and open source are similar in a lot of ways.  Whether your shared code is proprietary 
or open, you will need to work with other developers on the big picture.  

Do your homework, and contribute well-made web components.  Prepare your component well for use by others.

-----

## Suggested Assignment(s)

1) Make a creative project that demonstrates 5 of the following: 
  - [ ] Make sure your component's code is documented well
  - [ ] Add a README.md to your web component
  - [ ] Build your project with Polymer CLI
  - [ ] Check your project using Polymer lint (if you have a Polymer web component)
  - [ ] Create and demonstrate a demo for your web component
  - [ ] Bundle your project with Webpack
  - [ ] Publish your web component on GitHub (private or public)
  - [ ] Launch (or discuss how you would launch) a new shared/open source project

2) Complete all of the tasks in an interactive tutorial that covers this micro's goals: 
[How to Contribute to the Web Components ecosystem](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/web-components-how-to-contribute/index.html?index=..%2F..%2Fio2017#0)

3) Demonstrate how you've done nearly all of #1 in your work or side-work

4) Something else creative that proves you are totally legit in this topic
