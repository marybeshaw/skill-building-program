Accessibility - Screen Readers [Micro Badge]
===================================================

Est. time to complete: 3h

Goals:
------

- You have demonstrated how to use a screen reader to navigate a web site.


Intro
-----

> A screen reader enables blind and vision impaired people to use computers. It reads the text on the screen in a computerised voice. You can control what is read to you by moving the cursor to the relevant area of text with a mouse or the arrows on your keyboard. – [NV Access](https://www.nvaccess.org/)

Screen readers are used by users who are blind, have low vision, are illiterate, or have learning disabilities. Since screen readers read pages differently, it's best to test features using multiple screen readers for maximum compatibility.

Suggested Assignment(s)
---------------------

Choose one:

1) Choose a screen reader (either from the ones listed in the Suggested Study or one of your choosing) and learn to navigate web sites using it, and demonstrate and discuss your findings:

    1. Go to a content site you are familiar with (such as Smashing Magazine) and navigate an article by headings and landmarks. Read some of the article using the screen reader.

    2. Go to [Bankrates Amortization Calculator](http://www.bankrate.com/calculators/mortgages/amortization-calculator-b.aspx#9624570008_variation1) and fill out the form using only the screen reader. Then try to read the amortization schedule using the screen reader.

    3. Go to a site you work on or maintain and without looking at the screen (can even turn it off) go through an important user flow using only the screen reader.
