Performance - User Expectations [Micro Badge]
=============================================


Goals:
------

- You have demonstrated the basic foundations in Performance - User Expectations.
- You should know about the state of the web's performance and which timings matter most to users.


Intro
-----

*Performance is not an icing we slap on a cake after baking. Performance is an extremely important ingredient.*
> If you go to a luxury hotel, no matter how fancy the room was, the shower better have hot water.
> If you can't cover the basic expectations, don't bother adding anything fancy.
> Performance is the hot water in an interface. - paraphrased from Jared Spool, User Interface Engineering, Brain Sparks Podcast

It is very important as developers to know what users' expectations are before we build anything.
We do not generally think or behave like the majority of typical users, so we need to inform ourselves before making
any assumptions about their values or expectations.


Assignment
--------------------

- [ ] You must be able to explain the goal topics above and how they are used.
- [ ] Show how you can use your knowledge of users' performance expectations to make better products.
- [ ] Try to put the "Time and user perceptions" chart to memory, as it is the most critical part of this badge.
