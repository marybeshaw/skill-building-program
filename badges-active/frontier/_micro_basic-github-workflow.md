Frontier - Basic Github Flow [Micro Badge]
==============================================


Goals:
------

- You have demonstrated the basic foundations in a Basic Github Workflow.
- You should be aware of the general way that git and github work, and how we use it at work.


Intro
-----

> When you're working on a project, you're going to have a bunch of different features or ideas in progress at any given time – some of which are ready to go, and others which are not. Branching exists to help you manage this workflow. - Github Flow page

You don't always have to use git in the terminal, but it's very important to have a foundational knowledge of the operations that git is doing, even if you do them via a GUI git app. The "Github Flow" is a great workflow of managing "feature branches" and keeping them very close to master branch during development, so you don't have big, nasty merge conflict pain and bugs when you go to merge a long-lived behemoth branch before feature release.



Suggested Assignment(s)
-----------------------

Choose one:

1) Demonstrate the following:
- [ ] What are the benefits of the "Github Flow"?
- [ ] Explain & Demonstrate how to follow the "Github Flow"
- [ ] Demonstrate a "Pull Request" and explain why it's used
- [ ] Demonstrate "Forking"
- [ ] Demonstrate how to use a `.gitignore` file, and what it does
- [ ] Demonstrate you can do some command-line basics of Git, and explain what they do. (`add, branch, checkout, clone, commit, diff, init, log, merge, pull, push, rebase, reset, rm, status`)
