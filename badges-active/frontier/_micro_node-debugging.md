Frontier - Node Debugging & Memory Leaks [Micro Badge]
======================================================


Goals:
------

- You have demonstrated what how to debug Node.js, and how to find memory leaks in Node.js
- You should be aware of several of the common practices and techniques used to fix memory leaks in Node.js

Intro
-----

> Performance problems are best resolved with a methodical approach. Except in cases of clear regressions and other simple situations, resolving poor performance starts as a system-wide debugging affair. It's important to be able to narrow scope quickly and definitively. - Joyent, Debugging Performance Issues



Suggested Assignment(s)
-----------------------

### Choose one:

1) Demonstrate the following tasks in a Node.js app
  - [ ] Debugging local Node.js app, including logs and breakpoint inspection
  - [ ] Discovering a memory leak using tell-tale signs
  - [ ] Finding the cause of a memory leak
  - [ ] Explain what the most common causes of memory leaks tend to be, and how to code defensively to prevent them

2) Demonstrate how you've done all of the tasks above in your current work or side-projects
